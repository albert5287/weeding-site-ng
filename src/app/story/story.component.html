                    You have been my best friend, mentor, playmate, confidant, and my greatest challenge. But most
                    importantly, you are the love of my life and you make me happier than I could ever imagine and
                    more loved than I ever thought possible.

                    I love you for your beauty, your intelligence, your kindnessâ€¦ and for the way you always know
                    how to make me feel so special. So on top of all the other vows that I will make to you on our
                    wedding day, I also vow to always appreciate how lucky I am.
